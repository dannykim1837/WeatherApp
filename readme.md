## Overview

**Project Title**: Weather Forecast

**Project Description**: This project contains a simple Java program named Weather Forecast, which uses an open API to update data every hour and refreshes the weather information daily, allowing users to know the weather when they search for a place they want.

**Project Goals**: The main goal of the weather forecast Java program is to provide accurate and timely weather updates to users by using an open API that is updated every hour. The program also updates weather information on a daily basis, so that users can always stay up to date no matter where they search. It will have easy-to-use search capabilities and a user-friendly interface that works well with all devices.

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] When the user starts the program, I want to modify it so that the weather in the area of the last searched result by the user can come out.
* [ ] Currently, there are only four types of weather, but I want to add more details
* [ ] I want to make it work on mobile
